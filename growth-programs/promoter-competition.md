# promoter competition

Following the auction and Masterchef reward distributions, our community will recognize the top 5 promoters who provided the most value during the launch event through a structured incentive competition.

## **how it works**&#x20;

The competition will run for 2 rounds, allowing community members to update their votes as the event progresses. The first vote will be conducted at the conclusion of the auction (within 1 week) and the second at the conclusion of the believer rewards. Voting power is reassessed each round to reflect current community sentiment and holdings. smol.bot will be used to conduct the competition.

## **participation**

Promoters may self submit their candidacy in Discord and will be required to provide a verified wallet for the competition. Promoters will receive a Discord role to confirm their eligibility. Wallet holdings are public and may influence community voting decisions. Wallet deposits in the Believer contract will be used to determine the relative reward amount received by the promoter.

## **voting**&#x20;

Verified community members (smol role in Discord) may vote for promoters using their deposits in the Believer contract. Voting power corresponds to your Believer contract deposit amount. Voters may spread their vote across multiple promoters.

## **reward distribution**&#x20;

Rewards for each round are distributed proportionally among the top 5 promoters based on their relative Believer deposits at the round's snapshot.
