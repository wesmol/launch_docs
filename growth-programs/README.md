# growth programs

We believe that wesmol's success is derived from the collective contributions of its community members. To recognize and incentivize individual efforts that help grow the brand, reach, and available creative assets, we will run community contribution programs.

These initiatives are designed to support the diverse ways the initial community can add value to the launch, from promoting wesmol across social platforms to creating compelling graphics that strengthen our visual identity. By rewarding meaningful contributions, we aim to foster organic growth while ensuring that those contributing to wesmol are recognized for their efforts. Currently those programs include:

* &#x20;[Promoter Competition](promoter-competition.md)
* &#x20;[Community Art](community-art.md)

As the SMOL launch progresses, these programs may be adjusted, expanded, or replaced with new initiatives, but their supply allocation will remain. We will incorporate community feedback and pursue crowd sourced initiatives as wesmol takes shape. Our goal with these programs is to maintain flexibility while consistently supporting the community members who are actively contributing to wesmol's growth and success.
