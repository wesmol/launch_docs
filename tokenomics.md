The SMOL token distribution is designed to prioritize community participation and aid with long-term sustainability. Half of all tokens will be distributed during the launch event, with the remaining half locked for one year to support future community and ecosystem growth.

## launch distribution (50%)

* 20% Auction
* 15% Rewarders: Masterchef and Believer
* 6% LP
* 5% Smol Joes Presale (up to 5%)
* 4% Community Programs: Art and Promotion

The launch is purposely designed to generate interest in and kick start growth of the wesmol community. The launch will reward contributions across a variety of participants, and create the opportunity for an open, fair, and targeted token distribution.

## 1-year lock (50%)

* 30% Community and Ecosystem Development
* 10% Progekt
* 8% Reserves
* 2% Smol Joes Treasury

Locked allocations ensure wesmol's long-term sustainability while demonstrating genuine alignment of early contributors. Progekt and Smol Joes are choosing to lock their allocations for 1 year minimum, signaling belief in the long term potential of the idea underlying wesmol. The ecosystem and reserve allocations remain flexible by design, as wesmol evolves into a decentralized community, the use of these tokens will be determined based on what best serves the community's needs at that time.

## sale proceeds

* 50% will be utilized for AMM liquidity
* 50% will go to Progekt

Half of all token sale proceeds (auction and presale) will be deployed as protocol owned liquidity.
