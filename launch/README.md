# launch

### [disclaimer](./#disclaime)

## overview

The SMOL launch event is designed to bring back the energy and excitement of Avalanche's 2021 DeFi summer while introducing distribution mechanics created specifically for wesmol. Rather than a simple token drop, we've built a multi-stage event that offers multiple ways for the community to participate and contribute.

The launch combines familiar DeFi mechanics with custom-built contracts to promote fair distribution, reward early participation, and establish sustainable liquidity for the SMOL ecosystem.

## launch timeline

**1.** [**Presale**](presale.md) (<1 week) Exclusive opportunity for OG and Luminary Smol Joe holders to participate before the public launch. Demonstrates our connection to the community that incubated wesmol's ideas.

**2.** [**Auction**](auction.md) (\~2-4 weeks) Open Dutch auction using our custom contract for fair price discovery and broad community distribution. The largest component of the token distribution.

**3.** [**Masterchef**](masterchef.md) (until exhausted) Liquidity mining across multiple Avalanche DEXs to bootstrap trading liquidity and reward early ecosystem participants. Primary source of WESMOL during launch.

**4.** [**Believer**](believer.md) (\~6-8 weeks) Advanced reward contract for committed participants who want to demonstrate long-term belief in wesmol's potential. Requires WESMOL from Masterchef participation.

## WESMOL wrapper

During launch, reward tokens are distributed as WESMOL, a wrapped version of SMOL with additional functionality.

**Key Features:**

* WESMOL serves as the gating token for Believer contract participation
* Wrapping is disabled during launch (only available through Masterchef and Believer rewards)
* Unwrapping is disabled until the auction concludes
* Standard wrapper that can be unwrapped 1:1 for SMOL after launch

_**Important:** Do not unwrap WESMOL to SMOL if you plan to participate in Believer. You cannot wrap it back during the launch period._

## participation

The different aspects of the launch are intended to enable deeper engagement with the launch event while ensuring all community members can participate meaningfully in wesmol's beginning. Participants can contribute in a variety of ways:

* Trade the token with deep liquidity
* Deposit into the Masterchef for liquidity mining rewards
* Unlock gated holder rewards
* Contribute art
* Promote the event
