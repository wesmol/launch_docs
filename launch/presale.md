# presale

### [disclaimer](presale.md#disclaime)

## overview

In a way, the OG Smol Joe NFT collection, with its diversity of characters and the community it promised, incubated the ideas that would eventually become wesmol. A place where people could adopt the persona of a pizza box or a bull standing on a floatie, and find community engaged in a shared mission. We know everyone brings different skillsets and interests that can be harnessed for the good of the wesmol community.

_We must gather for the mission._

We are adopting the same pixel art style for our interpretation of wesmol's visual identity. We are embracing pixel art as a throwback to the early days of gaming. A tech era marked by rapid change, improvement, and boundless interest, it was a time when digital identities were first born and excitement was high. Much like the stage we find ourselves in with web3 today. Plus we just genuinely like the art style.

As a gesture of our appreciation, we are donating 2% of the SMOL supply to the Smol Joes Treasury and allowing participation in a presale of up to 5% of the supply to a limited set of Smol Joe holders. Only OG Smol Joe and Luminary Smol Joe NFT holders qualify for this allocation.
