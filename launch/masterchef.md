### [disclaimer](masterchef.md#disclaime)

## overview

The Masterchef is a SMOL liquidity mining initiative designed to bootstrap initial liquidity and reward early participants that help establish the SMOL trading ecosystem. As a standard AMM farm rewarder, Masterchef creates farms for different token pairs and single-token staking, distributing WESMOL rewards to participants who provide liquidity or stake their SMOL tokens.

Masterchef will run alongside the auction and represents the primary way to earn WESMOL early in the launch event, making it essential for users who want to participate in the [Believer](believer.md) contract.

## how it works

Masterchef will operate multiple independent farms, across prominent Avalanche DEXs, each with its own reward rate. Each farm distributes WESMOL rewards proportionally to participants based on their stake relative to the total pool deposits.

**LP Farms:**

* Provide liquidity to eligible SMOL trading pairs on the AMM of your choice
* Receive LP tokens representing your liquidity position
* Stake LP tokens in the Masterchef
* Earn WESMOL rewards proportional to your LP stake

**SMOL Farm:**

* Stake SMOL tokens directly (no LP required)
* Earn WESMOL rewards proportional to your SMOL stake

**Reward Distribution:**

* Rewards accumulate continuously for all farms
* Each farm has independent reward rates
* Claim WESMOL rewards at any time
* No lock-up periods or withdrawal penalties

## participation and timeline

Any SMOL holder will be able to participate in the Masterchef contract. Reward rates for each farm will change daily throughout the launch event to ensure an optimal distribution based on community engagement and trading activity. Depositors are encouraged to regularly monitor how rewards are being distributed.

Masterchef begins shortly after the auction starts and will run concurrently with other launch events. There will be an overlap period with Believer, allowing users to continue earning WESMOL that unlock additional Believer deposits.

## parameters

**Liquidity Farms:**

* **Standard AMM Liquidity Pools:** LFJ and Pharaoh (SMOL-AVAX pairs). More to be added.
* **SMOL:** Single stake

**Reward Distribution:**

* Individual LP farm rates adjusted dynamically during launch. The process for setting reward rates may change but will be transparent and communicated in Discord.
* The proportion of rewards allocated between single stake and LP will gradually shift to favor single stake as wesmol Treasury LP is deployed

_Farm reward rates and parameters will be adjusted throughout the launch event to ensure optimal participation and fair distribution._

## liquidity deployment

As the auction progresses, liquidity will be added gradually at the prevailing market rates. wesmol liquidity will be fully deployed by the conclusion of the believer contract.
