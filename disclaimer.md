# disclaimer

SMOL (the Token) is intended to function as an expression of support for, association with, and/or interest in promoting the ideals and beliefs embodied by wesmol (the Brand), the community that organizes around it, and association with the adopted or contributed artworks. SMOL is not intended to be, or to be the subject of, an investment opportunity, investment contract, or security of any type.&#x20;

Progekt LLC (the Issuer) is acting as an arm's length 3rd party with regard to the Token distribution, and is not acting in the capacity of financial advisor or fiduciary of any person that chooses to participate in the Token Launch event (the Event) or otherwise acquires the Token through any other means. The Token does not have any tangible or physical manifestation, and does not have any intrinsic value (nor does any person make any representation or give any commitment as to its value); is non-refundable and cannot be exchanged for cash (or its equivalent value in any other digital asset) or any payment obligation by the Issuer or any of its respective affiliates.

The Token does not in any way represent any shareholding, participation, right, title, or interest in the Issuer, its respective affiliates, or any other company, enterprise or undertaking, nor does the Token entitle token holders to any promise of fees, dividends, revenue, profits or investment returns, and are not intended to constitute securities in any relevant jurisdiction.&#x20;

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Issuer, its respective affiliates and service providers shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including, without limitation, any liability arising from default or negligence on the part of any of them, or any loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or data) arising from the use of published documentation or the Website, or any other materials published, or its contents (including without limitation any errors or omissions) or otherwise arising in connection with the same. Prospective acquirers of the Token should carefully consider and evaluate all risks and uncertainties associated with the distribution of the Token, participating in the Event, or using applications or platforms for the purpose of participating.

The information set out herein is only conceptual, provided solely for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES, and does not constitute any binding commitment. Please do not rely on this information in deciding whether to participate in the token distribution because ultimately, the development, release, and timing of any products, features or functionality that is communicated or implied remains at the sole discretion of the Issuer, or its respective affiliates, and is subject to change.&#x20;

The Issuer owns 10% of the Token supply subject to a 1 year lock and will receive 50% of the Event proceeds. The Issuer will custody predesignated assets, the Token and proceeds from the Event, for the purpose of advancing growth and adoption of the Brand, which are intended to be transitioned to an entity established solely for that stated purpose. If no transition occurs within a period of 2 years, the Issuer will retain and may use all assets for any other purpose, including those unrelated to the Token, the Brand, or any other related endeavor suggested or implied. The Issuer is not liable for any potential asset losses, through theft, loss of keys, or any other cause for inaccessibility, of any assets that it has designated for other purposes.
